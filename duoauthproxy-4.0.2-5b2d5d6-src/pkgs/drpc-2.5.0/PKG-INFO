Description: # Duo Remote Procedure Call (DRPC)
        ## Overview
        DRPC is a protocol through which Duo services may communicate with one another.
        It was originally created to allow for customers to perform an AD Sync
        (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yHvhVl8aBrjPW0-txfBF3kJ_wwdfJa2xQ6qZAH0iw5w/edit#slide=id.ga38edfaff_0_82)
        but is now also being used as an internal message passing protocol.
        
        ## Structure
        This repository contains multiple version of DPRC inside of the `/drpc` folder.
        Each directory represents a major (non-backward compatible) version of the DPRC
        protocol. This major versions must exist alongside one another so that trustedpath
        can easily support new versions going forward and old appliances in the field.
        
        ## Versioning
        The major version of any DPRC _package_ should be the greatest _protocol_ version
        supported by the package. The minor version of the package should be bumped during
        any substantial change or revision of any protocol therein. The patch version
        should be increased for bugfixes and small changes in keeping with semantic versioning.
        
        ## Building
        Building the authproxy can be done with `make sdist` or just `make` as it is the
        default goal. This will create a drpc-<version>.tar.gz inside of the `dist`
        folder at the root of the repo which is the suitable for use as a third-party
        package in other repos. 
        
        The version used for the package is controlled by the `__version__` inside of
        `drpc/__init__.py`.
        
        ## CI
        CI is done by the drpc repo in ci.duosec.org (https://ci.duosec.org/mirrors/drpc/pipelines).
        If you add a requirement to requirements.txt you may need to generate a new builder
        manually through the manual "builder" stage in gitlab.
        
        ## Testing
        DRPC tests can be run with `make test`.
